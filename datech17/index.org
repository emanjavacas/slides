* Introduction

** Context
#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- [[https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/mind-bending-grammars/][Mind-bending grammars]] (ERC project on individual grammar changes in 17th century Britain)

** Goals
#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Improving Corpus-Linguistics Research
- Simplifying Developement of Corpus Query/Annotation tools

* Improving Corpus-Linguistics Research

** Annotation-based Corpus Linguistics

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Corpus Query \Rightarrow hits
  - Filter False Positives
  - Add Linguistic Annotation
  - Quantitative Analysis

** Problems
 #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 - Linkage problem
 - Synchronization problem

** Linkage problem

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 Once hits have been extracted/annotated, back-pointers to the corpus are missing.
 #+END_NOTES

*** Typical Corpus Linguistics Workflow

*** Drawback
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 - Spread of non-reusable data


** Synchronization problem (in multi-user situations)

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 Annotations are being created by different researchers and have to derive in
 a coherent set (same tags, labels used with the same meaning, etc...).
 #+END_NOTES

 Two types of synchronization problems

 #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 - *Intrinsic* related to the linguistic annotation process itself
 - *Extrinsic* related to software synchronization challenges

** Intrinsic

Unifying annotation schemes and their usage

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We can list a number of issues related to the fact that annotation schemes
(linguistic categories, tag-sets, etc..) are typically not closed-set, but subject to revision.
#+END_NOTES

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Modification of tagsets (create, remove & change tags)
- Interpretational disagreements (spotting & correcting)

** Extrinsic
Fundamental problem of collaborative software/distributed systems

#+attr_reveal: :frag roll-in
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"How to ensure that dispersed users are able to modify a shared body of 
documents without overwriting each other's changes"
#+END_QUOTE

* Simplifying Developement of Corpus Query/Annotation tools

** Current issues

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Perhaps this isn't up to date, but it certainly was 18 months ago.
#+END_NOTES

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- End-to-end solutions that are hard to adapt (missing APIs)
- Monolothic solutions that are hard to integrate
- *Consequence* \Rightarrow Lots of rewritting, redundant tools

** Preliminary Solutions

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Bad news: we haven't solved the issue, but hopefully we haven't made it worse
#+END_NOTES

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Modular design in corpus-tool design

** Goals

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Tool that aims at improving CL-research and simplifying corpus tool developement
   #+END_NOTES
   
   #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
   - Encompass *Corpus Query Engine* + *Annotation Interface*
   - Enable *synchronized real-time annotation* of text
   - Follow *modular design* for easy reusability/adaptation of pre-exisiting tools

** Architecture

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Drawing inspiration from GitHub, and adding multi-user real-time features
#+END_NOTES

*** Web-based Client

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Real-time feedback client-to-client following a *Pub/Sub* architecture
- Subscribers are assigned roles with different permissions (resources access-control)
- Conflicts are explicitely resolved and documented using threads

*** Annotation Database
#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Support for Token & Span annotations (see also RelANNIS, Ziggurat).
- Version controlled. Each annotation has a revision history.

*** Corpus-query engine

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Decoupling of Front-end and Query-engine

#+REVEAL: split
[[./img/app-remote.jpg]]

#+REVEAL: split
- Decoupling of Front-end and Query-engine
#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Currently support for [[https://www.github.com/INL/BlackLab][BlackLab Server]]
- Ongoing work on support for [[http://cwb.sourceforge.net/][CQP]]

# ** Added advantages
#  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
#  - Structured annotation data:
#    - To what extent can linguistic annotation be automated.
#  - Reciprocal supervision (Am I using the categories as my peers do?)

* Remaining Challenges

** Incremental Indexing of Corpus Annotations

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- How to make the corpus query engine aware of the new annotations

** Scale

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Support large user groups (Currently working with some few dozens)

* Thank you!
