<p>
The project we&rsquo;re presenting is part of a large-scale initiative by the CPNB (‘Collective for the Promotion of the Dutch Book’). 
</p>

<p>
In Autumn 2017, CPNB will launch their annual media campaign, that this year focuses on robotics.
</p>

<p>
To this end, CPNB will distribute a re-edition of the Dutch translation of Isaac Asimov’s <b>I, Robot</b> that is planned to include an additional piece written as part of a human-machine collaboration.
</p>

<p>
The CPNB is a trust and PR agency based in The Netherlands that aims to promote the visibility of books and the publishing sector in Dutch society at large.

<p>
Write a story about robots, using a robot, in relation to &ldquo;I, Robot&rdquo;
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
We were asked to get a robot to write a story, which obviously, &ldquo;is very easy &#x2026; (the robot does all the work)&rdquo;, and therefore it might as well be relatively long, &#x2026; and published. 
</p>

<p>
So originally we were asked for a full novel.

<p>
Co-creatively write a science-fiction story using a system trained on similar literature
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Presented with this opportunity &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
of generating some kind of story,  we saw the involvement of the CPNB as a lucrative opportunity to work with an established author.
</p>

<p>
To Co-creatively write a story, with an author that is interested in science fiction, and use a system trained on similar literature. 
</p>

<p>
We wanted to create genre and author based tools for text generation, and find out which of those were useful/ relevant to a human author within the same field. 
</p>

<p>
We proposed a system that allowed an author to orchestrate generated text into a narrative. Here, picking up the accepted shortcomings in neural network based approaches to NLG.

<img src="img/rg.jpg" alt="Image of Ronalf Giphart">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The author within the project was Ronald Giphart, who is to all extents and purposes an object of study, or evaluation. 
</p>

<p>
In line with [@roemmele<sub>creative</sub><sub>2015</sub>], we acknowledge that such a co-creative interface opens the up possibility for automatic evaluation of generative systems based on user edits of generated strings. 
</p>

<p>
Our interface is therefore designed to store all user edits along with the source of the string (human or machine generated). 
</p>

<p>
This will enable us to study individual user behavior in relation to the particular properties of the generative system, as well as the aptness of different model variants and their parameter settings.
</p>

<p>
Here, taking user edit behavior as a proxy for output quality.

<p>
Science Fiction is open to collaborating with researchers on experimental projects
</p>

<img src="img/asimov_cover.jpg" alt="The original cover of 'I, Robot'">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Science fiction is of course a welcoming genre for text generation projects. The idea of machines writing stories sounds like something from an Asimov story. 
</p>

<p>
The novel &rsquo;I, robot&rsquo; is about a robots&rsquo;s place in society and how to differentiate a robot from a human. 
</p>

<p>
Ronald Giphart, the author, was eager to collaborate because as a writer interested in science fiction he had asked himself many of our own questions. Yet, from a fictional point of view.

&#x2026; a collaborative process between multiple agents, where in this context, one agent is a computational system.

</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Co-creativity is an important term within computational creativity, with a handful of different interpretations.
</p>

<p>
In its broadest sense, Co-creativity is a collaborative process between multiple agents, where in this context, one agent is a computational system. 
</p>

<p>
Davis sees co-creativity as the ’blending’ of improvisational forces [@davis<sub>human</sub>-computer<sub>2013</sub>]. This goes against a pragmatic distribution of labor that we might see in creative support systems, or how computers are treated in everyday life, and invites them into an indistinct and overlapping process of creativity. Where crucially, the result of the output is greater than ’the sum of its parts’ [@davis<sub>human</sub>-computer<sub>2013</sub>].

<h3 id="orgb42034a">Different Takes on Co-creativity</h3>
<ul>
<li>The public are suspicious of systems that purport to be &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; but involve human participation (Jordanous 2017)</li>
<li>For Lubart the opposite is the case (Lubart 2005)</li>
<li>Lubart clarifies co-creativity into four distinct roles for a computational system:
<ul>
<li>Computer as <b>nanny</b>, <b>penpal</b>, <b>coach</b> or <b>colleague</b></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Interestingly, as pointed out by Jordanous 2017, the public are suspicious of systems that purport to be autonomous whilst in fact involve human participation.
</p>

<p>
Lubart clarifies co-creativity through four distinct roles; ’Computer as nanny’, ‘Computer as penpal’, ‘Computer as coach’, ‘Computer as colleague’ [@lubart<sub>how</sub><sub>2005</sub> p. 366].
</p>

<p>
In this project we are most interested in achieving the last, though in practice, much of what our system does could be considered under the second. 
</p>

<section id="slide-orgcd9bad1">
<h4 id="orgcd9bad1">Computer as colleague</h4>
<ul>
<li>A competent agent within the writing process</li>
<li>A verifiable contribution to the end product</li>
<li>An agent that challenges the user in a meaningful way</li>
<li>More than mere generation</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
For the computer to be considered a &rsquo;colleague&rsquo; they should be treated as a competent agent within the process, to whom meaningful contributions can be assigned. 
</p>

<p>
Their role may overlap heavily with the user, but their participation is certainly vital to the production as it is.
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org714a75f">
<h4 id="org714a75f">Computer as penpal</h4>
<ul>
<li>A subordinate agent, that eases the objective of the user</li>
<li>Does not challenge the user</li>
<li>Produces &rsquo;mere generation&rsquo;</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
On the other spectrum from colleague, there is the co-creativity of assistance, or you could argue lack of creativity by &rsquo;mere&rsquo; assistance.
</p>

<p>
A valid collaboration should provoke, even disrupt, the writer. It should test them, push them, and ask them to reconsider their approach. Ideally from a relevant point of view. 
</p>

<p>
In assistance, the generated text acts as a kind of lucky dip of sentences for the writer, and in fact, the writer would probably prefer to just write something themself but cant be bothered.
</p>

<p>
To balance these appraoches, we chose to treat the writer as a competent handler of the system, completely capable of dealing with generated language, and unlikely to be overwhelmed. 
</p>

<p>
We gave them a detailed explanation of the output of generated text, with multiple suggestions, and control over the model. We&rsquo;ll return to this in the second half of the presentation.

<p>
There are two established approaches within existing literature: the structural diagramatic approach, and the auto-completion approach. 
</p>

</aside>

<section id="slide-orgae19b71">
<h3 id="orgae19b71">The Structural Diagramatic Approach</h3>
<p>
Maps the narrative steps of a story for the writer to manipulate into an eventual story structure, the system will then use probabilistic modeling to generate language around that skeleton (Ahn et al. 2016)
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Ahn, Morbini and Gordon use causal graphs to map the narrative steps of a story which the writer can manipulate into the eventual story structure, the system will then use probabilistic modeling to generate language around that skeleton. This approach gives the system access to the abstract narrative core of a story’s structure; arguably, in doing so the system imposes upon the writer a far more structured approach than they are possibly familiar with. A collaborative system should be able to fit within a writers existing working process [@ahn<sub>improving</sub><sub>2016</sub>].
</p>

</aside>

<section id="slide-orgc9043f0">
<h3 id="orgc9043f0">The Auto-Completion Approach</h3>
<p>
The writer is prompted with possible sentences (Roemmele 2015)
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Roemelle and Gordon offer a more hands on approach to assistive writing. Their system acts as a ’Narrative Auto-Completion’, where the writer is prompted with possible sentences [@roemmele<sub>creative</sub><sub>2015</sub>]. Though straightforward, this approach is highly intuitive and unobtrusive; however, the system risks fulfilling the role of tool rather than collaborator.

<p>

Uncharacteristically for an NLP project, the visual interface of the system is paramount to its success. 
</p>

<p>
Though ultimately the system will be assessed on the language it produces, such language can only be generated if the writer is able to use the system, and believe that it is worth using. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we have focused on functionalities that give the user a clear representation of how text is generated, and allow them to understand how their own writing works within the process. 
</p>

<p>
This allows them to understand the system&rsquo;s role within the process of writing, whilst also encouraging them to use generated text.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The text is visually annotated, which reveals to the writer how generated text is affecting their own writing. 
</p>

<p>
From the outset, we envisaged that the user would be confused if they lost track of what was generated and written. Especially as the two converge. 
</p>

<p>
As the writer works into text, they could easily lose track of its source; therefore, the interface is enhanced with visual feedback which highlights based on edit distance between original generated text and its current status.
